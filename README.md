This is the public repository of rnott.org, a collection of projects that hopefully prove useful when developing software. Although
most (all?) of the code here is Java, some projects may still prove useful outside of a Java environment.

A mock service project that can be used for both stress/performance and unit/feature testing use cases. The service is a Jetty server instance that allows endpoints and potential responses to be configured.
